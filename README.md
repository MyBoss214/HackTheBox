Survive the outbreak. Free the campus!

At approximately [redacted] hours at site-B, a containment breach of Serum-XY caused a collapse of the facility. Be advised, we have a report that hostile dead are reanimating and are on route to Hackster University.
Initial contact has been made with the campus. Collective groups of students have begun locking down the college and forming teams. Students are orchestrating offensive cyber measures in a bid to use campus technology to control the infrastructure and stay ahead.
Get your skills and resources to procure essential supplies and aid fellow survivors amid relentless hordes of adversaries. Time races against them, emphasizing that only through collective efforts can they hope to endure. Will you manage to evade the zombies and safeguard your fellow students?
